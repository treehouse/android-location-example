Android Location Example (with Google Play Services)
========================

This is an example project of how to use Location Services from Google Play Services to find a user's current location and display it on a map. It is built on the "Google Map Activity" template from Android Studio and is featured in a [Treehouse blog post about location in Android](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/beginners-guide-location-android).

For an alternative way to organize location-related code, please check out the [refactored version of this sample project](https://github.com/treehouse/android-location-example-refactored).
